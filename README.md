#Tasks:
### Unit tests
- Test core
	- OrderManagementProcessor
	- OrderProcessor
	- PositionProcessor
	- AccountProcessor
	- NotificationProcessor

Recommendation:
- use give-when-then approach
- write some tests with mockito and without
- other test frameworks can be used

### Integration tests
- Test rest points 

Recommendation:
- use REST Assured framework
- automate login in tests (own runner or rules)
- split tests to groups, depend from processor
